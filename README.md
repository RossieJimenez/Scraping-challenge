# Mars Data Analysis

## Overview
This project involves the analysis of Mars-related data, including daily minimum temperatures and information about the length of a Martian year. The primary goal is to estimate the number of terrestrial (Earth) days in a Martian year and visualize this using a line plot of the daily minimum temperatures.

## Files
* mars_data_analysis.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data scraping, analysis, and visualization.
* data.csv: Sample dataset with Martian weather information.


## Instructions
1. Open the mars_data_analysis.ipynb notebook using Jupyter Notebook.
2. Execute the code cells sequentially to perform data scraping, analysis, and visualization.
3. Ensure that the required Python libraries are installed using pip install pandas matplotlib if not already installed.
4. The notebook includes comments and explanations for each step of the analysis.

## Data Sources
* The data used for analysis is stored in the data.csv file.

## Results
* The main outcomes of the analysis include a line plot of daily minimum temperatures on Mars and an estimate of the number of terrestrial days in a Martian year.
